#### Feature Selection in R using glmnet-lasso, xgboost and ranger
<br>
  This is a wrapper-package for glmnet-lasso, xgboost and ranger. It can be installed using the install_github('mlampros/FeatureSelection') of the devtools package. After downloading use ? to read info about each function (i.e. ?feature_selection). More details can be found in the [blog post](http://mlampros.github.io/2016/02/14/feature-selection/).
